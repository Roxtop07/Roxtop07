Hi, I’m Manish 👋

I’m a Computer Science student rebuilding my GitHub from scratch.

Right now, my focus is simple:
- learn backend development properly
- build small but real projects
- understand fundamentals instead of rushing buzzwords

What I’m working on:
- Python as my primary language
- Backend APIs (learning by building)
- SQL & database design
- Basic DSA for problem solving

I’m documenting everything I learn — including mistakes — through code and projects.

This GitHub will reflect my progress over time.
